# Bandcamp Shuffle

</p>

Bandcamp Shuffle is a Firefox add-on that will shuffle collections on Bandcamp pages.

## ‚ö° Getting Started

[You can download the add-on for Firefox here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/bandcamp-shuffle/).

## üìñ Usage

![Bandcamp Shuffle in use](assets/usage.gif)

Once the add-on is enabled you should see a button in your Firefox address bar when viewing a
bandcamp.com page. If the page contains a collection of albums it will shuffle the visible albums
(this is only temporary - refreshing the page will reset it to the original order).

In the add-on Preferences you can also enable a mode to first show all albums in the collection
before shuffling. This is a more useful approach, but it's turned off by default as it relies on
a private Bandcamp API and may be unreliable.
